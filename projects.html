  <h1>My Minecraft-Inspired Projects</h1>
  <p>Here’s a look at some of the cool things I’ve built and created in the world of games and code:</p>

  <h2>🎮 Game Site</h2>

  <h2>📻 YouTube Channel</h2>
  <p>On my YouTube channel, I post Minecraft content, coding tips, walkthroughs, and fun projects. Make sure to subscribe: <a href="https://youtube.com/@prestonwoodland">@prestonwoodland</a></p>

  <h2>🌐 Website Experiments</h2>
  <p>I’m always playing around with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build fun little sites — like this one! If you’re into coding or want to learn, follow along!</p>

  <p>I also have a lot more planned including custom Minecraft plugins, a resource pack of my own, and an entire open-world pixel game coded from scratch. Stay tuned!</p>
